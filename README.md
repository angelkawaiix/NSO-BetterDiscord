# How to Download

You need [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/ "BetterDiscord") to use this theme.
Note: This theme has not been tested with [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/ "Vencord"), since I do not know how it works.

Downloade the [lastest release](https://github.com/angelkawaiix/NSO-betterdiscord/releases "lastest release").

Place the file titled **nso.theme.css** in your BetterDiscord themes folder.
Hint: `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes`

## To Do
- Add example images to the github
- Change reaction background color
- Change right click color
- Change link colors
- Make a dark mode
- Change / command colors
- change reply background color
- Change main chat scroll color

This is my first ever discord theme, and first time posting on GitHub, so bear with me.
